# üåßÔ∏è ESP32 Rainfall Sensor (Tipping Bucket + MQTT)

A robust, Wi-Fi-connected **ESP32 rainfall monitor** based on the **DFRobot SEN0575 tipping-bucket rain gauge**.  
The project measures rainfall accurately, handles Wi-Fi reconnects and DST automatically, and publishes live and hourly rainfall data to an MQTT broker for visualization (Home Assistant, Node-RED, Grafana, etc.).

## üì¶ Features

‚úÖ **Accurate rainfall measurement**  
- Uses **DFRobot SEN0575** tipping-bucket rain gauge (reed switch output).  
- Detects every tip via an interrupt on ESP32 GPIO.  
- Each tip equals a configurable rainfall volume (default `0.28 mm`).  

‚úÖ **Time-aware data logging**  
- Uses ESP32 SNTP with automatic **CET/CEST DST** correction.  
- Keeps a rolling log of **7 days √ó 24 hours** rainfall totals.  

‚úÖ **MQTT integration**  
- `/test/rainfall/impulse` ‚Üí Real-time impulses with current-hour total.  
- `/test/rainfall/hourly` ‚Üí Retained 7-day snapshot with all hourly values.  
- Messages use the most reliable delivery supported by PubSubClient.  

‚úÖ **Offline recovery**  
- Continues counting rainfall while offline.  
- Sends all accumulated data once Wi-Fi or MQTT reconnects.  

‚úÖ **Resilient Wi-Fi**  
- Automatically switches between primary and backup SSID.  
- Detects stuck connection attempts and resets the interface.

## üß∞ Hardware

| Component | Model / Description | Connection |
|------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **ESP32 DevKit** | ESP-WROOM-32 or WROVER module | Main controller |
| **Rain gauge** | [DFRobot SEN0575](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Tipping_Bucket_Rain_Gauge_SKU__SEN0575) tipping-bucket sensor | `Signal ‚Üí GPIO27`, `GND ‚Üí GND` |
| **Power** | 5 V USB or regulated 5 V supply | via ESP32 Vin/USB |

üß© **SEN0575 notes**
- Output is a simple **reed switch** (digital on/off).  
- Internal magnet closes contact once per bucket tip (‚âà 0.28 mm of rain).  
- ESP32 pin uses `INPUT_PULLUP`, so **no external resistor** is required.  
- Ensure the cable and junctions are **weatherproof** for outdoor use.
